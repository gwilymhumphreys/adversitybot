Hallo!



adversitybot is a bot that shows some info on how tough a teams run was in a season. It's only checking s34 for now, expect it to change to the latest season with a season select flag in the near future.



To check a teams history give the bot one of the following commands in the `adversitybot` channel or via DM. Team names are **case sensitive**!

`!adversity` or `!a` prints some stats and a table of games
```!a My lovely team name```

`!adversityshort` or `!as` prints a shorter table for mobile
```!as My lovely team name```

`!adversitylong` or `!al` prints a longer table with team names
```!al My lovely team name```

Remember to add a codeblock to preserve formatting if you copy paste the bots responses (\`\`\`)



Current default season is `34`
Use `-s <season number>`` to select a different season
```!a -s 35 My current team```



To add adversitybot to your channel head to <https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=747055885645381662&scope=bot>

It's well behaved and will only respond to DMs or messages from a channel named 'adversitybot'



Head to the `general` channel for comments, suggestions, etc
