Hallo!

adversitybot is a bot that shows some info on how tough a teams run was in a season. It's only checking s34 for now, expect it to change to the latest season with a season select flag in the near future.


To check a teams history give the bot one of the following commands in the `adversitybot` channel or via DM. Team names are **case sensitive**!

`!adversity` or `!a` <team name>
```!a My lovely team name```

`!adversityshort` or `!as` <team name>
```!as My lovely team name```

`!adversitylong` or `!al` <team name>
```!al My lovely team name```

----------------

To add adversitybot to your channel head to  https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=747055885645381662&scope=bot

It's well behaved and will only respond to DMs or messages from a channel named 'adversitybot'

Head to the `general` channel for comments, suggestions, etc
